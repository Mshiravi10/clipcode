## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all code
- Enable strict mode
- Avoid `any` types
- Use proper type annotations

### React

- Use functional components
- Prefer Server Components when possible
- Use React hooks appropriately
- Follow React best practices

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `snippet-card.tsx`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `SnippetCard`)
- **Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `fetchSnippets`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_SNIPPETS`)

### Code Style

We use Prettier for code formatting. Run before committing:

```bash
pnpm format
```

We use ESLint for linting. Check with:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

Examples:
```
Add snippet version history feature

- Implement version tracking in Prisma schema
- Add API endpoints for version CRUD
- Create UI for viewing version history
- Add tests for version functionality

Fixes #123
```

### Branch Naming

- `feature/` - New features (e.g., `feature/add-tags`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/search-crash`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/auth-logic`)
- `test/` - Adding tests (e.g., `test/search-service`)

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
pnpm test

# E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for new features
- Update tests when modifying existing features
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```typescript
describe('searchSnippets', () => {
  it('should return snippets matching the search query', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const query = 'react hooks';
    
    // Act
    const results = await searchSnippets(query);
    
    // Assert
    expect(results.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(results[0].title).toContain('react');
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Update API docs for API changes
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Include examples in documentation

## Database Changes

When modifying the database schema:

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Create a migration: `pnpm prisma migrate dev --name your_migration_name`
3. Update seed data if necessary
4. Test migrations on a fresh database

## Performance Considerations

- Avoid N+1 queries (use Prisma `include` or `select`)
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Optimize images and assets
- Monitor bundle size
- Use React Server Components when possible

## Security

- Never commit secrets or API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries (Prisma handles this)
- Follow OWASP best practices
- Report security issues privately

## Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (linting, tests, build)
2. **Code review** by at least one maintainer
3. **Discussion** of approach and implementation
4. **Approval** before merging

## Questions?

- Check the [documentation](docs/)
- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Mshiravi10/clipcode/issues)
- Ask in [discussions](https://github.com/Mshiravi10/clipcode/discussions)
